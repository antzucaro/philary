This is the source to Phil and Hilary's wedding website. I built it using Foundation by Zurb (foundation.zurb.com) using Vim, Python, Mako, and Firefox. 
Several folders are required, all of which contain images:

- original: full size images
- small: 250x250 thumbnails
- medium: max 650px images
- large: max 1000px images

  Once these folders are created and populated with images, run generate.py in the directory to get a web source that can be copied anywhere you see fit. Enjoy!
